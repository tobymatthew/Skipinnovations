           <ul>
               <li>
           <p>I direct the tech non-profit Callisto. We created an online sexual assault reporting tool. 
               Among other things, this tool helps detect repeat perpetrators, who commit 90% of sexual assaults.</p>
            </li>
            <p>[Sometimes] a victim only wants to report if they know they aren't the only victim of a given perpetrator. 
                They can hold a record of their assault in our escrow and then release it in event of a match with another victim.</p>
                <p>I think a tool similar to ours could work for sexual harassment as well 
                    - helping to detect serial harassers and lowering the risk of reporting for any given victim.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
    <p>Recently, I was followed in the train station by a man who insisted on harassing me. 
        With the language barrier I have being an American in Germany, I wasn't confident in my ability to make him go away..</p>
     </li>
     <p>Nothing transpired, other than 30 minutes of discomfort.</p>
         <p>[But] I wished there was an app to find someone willing to help... something I could wordlessly activate and get help, 
             whether from law enforcement or from background-checked volunteers - or even paid people who would come and get me to safety..</p>

    <b>'A way to share a sense of unease' - Teresa, Paranaque City, Philippines</b>
</div>
    <ul>
        <li>
    <p>[My] idea is an app with two levels, where the first press means harassment and the second means imminent danger. 
        When a woman is harassed, she turns on the app along with GPS.</p>
     </li>
     <p>Her pertinent information, like location and the option to call her, is sent out to other users. The app would also screen users
          - since stalkers could use the same information - using things like residence and place of work.</p>
         <p>The information could also be sent to a nearby law enforcement office...</p>
